* Problem with dataset :- For example, if a hockey team is winning gold medal they are not considering it as 1 but as 11 as every player has gold medals.

* There is small variation is number of medals when compared with actual number of medals even after removing the duplicate values, this is because of some exceptional cases for few countries.
